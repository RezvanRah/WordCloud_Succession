NEWS ANCHOR: In terms of M&A action,

we're hearing that GoJo and Waystar

could seal their long-gestated
deal as soon as tomorrow.

Word is that regulatory
concerns have receded.

So Lukas Matsson may soon take control

of the deceased Logan Roy's empire

to add to his streaming, betting,

sports, and socials everything app

- to create that all-singing...
- KENDALL ROY: All right.

Okay, okay. Carpe the diem, people.

(CYRUS TELLIS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

KENDALL: Hey, hey! Okay.

Telly! Let's run this, uh,
board presentation, shall we?

- Yeah, great. Thanks. (SIGHS)
- Good stuff.

- So, uh...
- KENDALL: What?

Just Stewy. That was his guy,

- and, um...
- Yeah?

Yeah, I don't think we got him.

Uh-huh.

Cool. Cool.

(INHALES DEEPLY) Really?

- Where is he?
- Um...

KENDALL: Get me him direct.
It might be smokescreen.

I think... Yeah, that'll be...
that'll be smokescreen.

I can pull in Stew.

- Ken, I...
- (SIGHS) Man.

I don't think we have the shareholders,

and I don't think we have the
board numbers to stop this.

I'll get the votes.

Uh, if we had more
time, but by tomorrow?

- I'll get the votes.
- Ken, we...

You wanna just, uh,
outline the path here?

Okay. I got fucking me, I got Ewan,

I got Paul, I got Dewi. Locked.

- So, yeah?
- Mm-hmm. Okay, great. And?

And I still think I can get Stewy.

I think maybe Sonya.

Maybe Frank. There are
multiple, multiple routes.

Right now, you have
four, and one of them...

And is Roman even gonna
show? Is he gonna vote?

Don't worry about Roman.

- But just where does he stand?
- KENDALL: I don't know.

I don't know. I don't know.
I don't fucking know. Okay?

I don't know.

Okay? Does that make you feel better?

- (SCOFFS)
- KENDALL: I don't know where he is.

I don't know where he
stands. But I got him. Okay?

I fucking got this, Telly Bear.

Okay! I think they lost Stewy.

He's wonked. So that means we got...

(LAUGHS) ... Kendall in the trunk,

all trussed up and
ready to fucking bake!

- Yeah?
- It's good.

Okay. 'Cause, you know,
we got me, obviously...

Here. Uh... me, Simon, Frank,

Sandy and Sandi, locked.
And then Stewy. I...

Look, he talks a lot of shit,
but I think he's gonna stay.

He's not gonna split.
'Cause money, honey, right?

So, then we got Diane Liu, Sonya.

And then we... we have it.

Then, if we peel off
Dewi, Paul, and Ewan,

then there's only, like... is that...

Ken and Rome in the against.

That's fuck'... And
Rome might not even show up

from whatever jerk dungeon
he's being pity-spanked in.

You happy?

- Very happy. Very... yeah.
- SHIV ROY: Uh-huh. Yeah. Good.

Success! Yeah.

Oh, and, uh, I'm checking in on Frank,

if you wanna still do
the old-school signing?

- Perfect.
- You know, um, me as new CEO?

Yes? Uh, and your list?
What's... what's on...

You wanna talk Tom?

Or I know you've been
thinking about ATN?

And just... just say out
loud. It's no big deal for me.

Well, we've, uh, we've had some

initial, like, um, vibe meets, um...

Yeah, I mean, he's
sh1tting himself. (LAUGHS)

Yeah. Well, the delta between a guy

and a x guy is...

is obviously life and death,

- and ATN is central. So...
- SHIV: Sure.

(SIGHS) Tom. Tom.

Yeah. I don't know.
Um... what do you think?

Okay. Well, he's very
competent, but if he irks you,

or it's complicated, it is okay.

- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

He is very plausible corporate matter,

but he's also just a highly
interchangeable modular part.

And I would say that to his face.

- Okay.
- Okay, but if we wanted continuity

because there's been a lot of changes...

You know, ATN is going gangbusters,

and he is well-liked.
So if he were to stay on,

that would also be okay with me.

- Okay, good to know.
- SHIV: Yeah.

This is separate feelings aside,

Tom will honestly suck the
biggest d*ck in the room.

- That's just my assessment.
- Love is in the air.

- SHIV: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

How are things going?

Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Good. Good. Thanks.

CAROLINE: Great.

I just wanted to know if there
was any chance of you coming?

(SIGHS) Yeah. I mean...
Look, I would love to,

but I think, you know, fuck' schedules

- CAROLINE: Yeah, I know, but...

Well, there's somebody here
I think you might want to see.

I promised I wouldn't say, but it's...

one of your brothers.
And it's not Kendall.

Oh. Okay. Well, let me cr*ck the code.

- CAROLINE: I just thought you'd like to know.
- Uh. Yeah, well...

Let me have a think. But let's...

Yeah, let's try and... Let's

Great.

- LUKAS MATSSON: The cartoon?
- SHIV: Yeah.

I think it's funny.

- SHIV: Yeah?
- Like...

"Oh, look at me! Look at me!"

- Uh-huh. Yeah, 'cause I...
- (CHUCKLES) It's good. Yeah.

'Cause I can get the...
the journalist, you know,

- maybe take the online?
- LUKAS: No, no.

I don't give a fuck.
People always try to fuck'...

- get at me, you know?
- SHIV: Okay.

- LUKAS: They can't.
- Uh, look, that was... that was, uh,

an associate of mine,

indicating they got a fix on Roman.

So why don't I just fuck'
go and nail Roman as well?

It would be so nice just to
get unanimity across the board.

You know, all of us
smiling in public, just...

just nice, clean start
for the start of our reign.

- All right.
- SHIV: Yeah? 'Cause, you know, corporate narrative.

If we're on separate sides,
it looks like Lady Macbeth Part Two.

And that's not... It would be...

It would, just in
an... It would be nice,

in an abundance of caution, just to...

- close nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

Great. All right. Call
me whenever, wherever.

- LUKAS: Yeah.
- I'm available. Okay? Yeah?

- Let's fuck' do this. Yeah?
- LUKAS: Go get him.

- (CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Hey, Shiv.

- What are you hearing?
- Uh, Rome's at my mom's.

So I'm on my way to bag him.
I'm looking for unanimity.

Okay. He's at your mom's?

And have you spoken to Lukas?

Um, am I for the chop?

(SIGHS) Yeah, I mean, I'm trying.

TOM WAMBSGANS: Okay. I'm just...
I'm... I got a bad feeling.

We've... we've booked
me in for the third hang.

It's excruciating.
I'm just... I'm scared

he's gonna want to play online games,

and I'll be running into
a wall for hours. You know?

Tom. Hey, Tom, can we
have a real conversation?

- Uh-huh.
- SHIV: Okay. So, on the Matsson stuff,

I'll do what I can. I'm
trying. But, uh, with us,

I just... I wanted to
get a few things straight.

Yeah. I just... Yeah. I just
want it to be really nice.

And we should... we should,
uh, Czechoslovakia it. You know?

We should make it all lovely
velvet, parting of the ways.

So, for you, there's...
there's not anything left?

Well, how do you mean?

Uh, well, I... I wondered if...

You know, I guess I thought
it might be worth raising.

Are there any, uh, positives

about the nightmare we've shared?

As in?

I guess if... if there
was anything there.

Uh... If there was, then
it would be so convenient.

Yeah, well, it would
be incredibly convenient

because you would be
married to your husband.

(CHUCKLING) Yeah, exactly.

And then when you think
of the scheduling, it's...

it's mess free.

Yeah. You've fallen in love finally.

You've, uh, you've fallen in love

with our scheduling opportunities.

Uh-huh.

And I would also, you
know, I would love to...

not to have, uh...

You don't like to fail
a test, do you, Siobhan?

Well...

Uh, look.

I know that we've said the worst things.

But I...

I think I've always just been scared

in relationships of, uh...

you know, like...

the underneaths.

You know, what's the worst thing
a person thinks? But we know.

But... once you've said
and done the worst things,

you're kind of free.

Yeah, I guess... I
guess my question is...

are you interested in
a real relationship?

Honest to God, I don't know... Shiv.

I just... I, uh...

I just don't know.

Okay. Sure. Right. Bye.

Huh. That's a good one. (LAUGHS)

I'm a grinder. I grind 'cause I worry.

I worry all night about everything.

All the, uh, threats to...
to me and to my, um...

(CLEARS THROAT) ... my division
and my physical body. And I...

I, uh, I have an excess of vigilance,

I think, and I have a
very, very high tolerance

for pain and physical discomfort.

Can I... can I be frank with you?

- Can... can you be discreet?
- fuck yeah.

(CLEARS THROAT) So, the thing is, um,

with Shiv, uh...

And with the votes coming up and all,

can we keep this, like,
close to our chests

- until I know my numbers?
- Oh, sure.

I think it's all fine.
It's just I... (SIGHS)

I have this thing with...
with her, um, which is like...

Like is it... is it a
bit too much? You know?

- Okay. The cartoon?
- No. fuck the cart...

That was funny. I enjoyed that. No.

She was kind of pushy
on the India tactics.

And at first, I thought

family continuity would be an upside.

- You know? But...
- TOM: Mm-hmm.

She... she is... She is smart. But...

I got plenty of ideas, okay?

I don't know if I need more ideas.

I was in need a little bit
of the political connection,

you know, but it turns
out it's fucking easy.

(CHUCKLING) It really is,
you know? And with Ebba,

- You do.

I think you... I mean, you do, man.

- Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

Yeah. Plus, with Shiv, there's also...

You know, um...

She...

- (CHUCKLES) She's somewhat...
- (TOM CHUCKLES)

Um...

We're a bit clickety-clickety,
if you know what I'm saying.

- Right. Like...
- A little bit...

I wanna fuck her, um, a... a little bit.

And I think, under...

Sorry to get weird, but, like,
the right circumstances...

she... I think she'd fuck me, too.

Uh-huh.

Is this making you uncomfortable?

- I'm sorry if it's weird, or...
- No, no. We're men.

Yeah, I can't deal with
the mess of that, you know?

So then I was thinking,
"Well, if I can have

fucking anyone in the world..."

(CHUCKLES) "... why don't I get the guy

who put the baby inside her
instead of the baby lady?"

Yeah?

Right. Well... I could do it.

I'm not looking for a partner.

You know? I'm looking for a front man.

We're gonna get right fucking in there.

I think it would be me. Right?

Well...

Dad said that it would be me.

When?

Well, we were getting
close again, before,

and you know this, mostly,

and I was texting, and he was warm,

and he said when I was
with him late one night

that it should be...

- KENDALL: Hmm.
- Persuasive.

What else did he say
when no one was around?

That he was the Zodiac
k*ller? That he did Tupac?

Whatever. It's fucking...
I said it. It's true. And yeah.

fuck it. Do whatever you want with that.

It's just the fucking truth.

Well, he offered it to me too, Rome.

Oh, yeah?

He... he... he fuck'
promised it to me.

Promised. When I was
seven. He sat me down

at the Candy Kitchen in Bridgehampton,

and he fucking promised it to me.

Seven years old.

- Like, can you imagine?
- Yeah.

Pics or it didn't happen.

That was... messed up. Like,
he shouldn't have done that.

No. He shouldn't have said that.

I'm simply saying he
said a lot of things,

and he said them to me first.

Yeah, and he said it to me last.

Do you even want it?

Because...

At the funeral, yeah? Like...
You... you're not that guy.

- You're not...
- ROMAN: What?

KENDALL: You couldn't do the rounds.

- I mean, you kinda...
- Well, what?

- KENDALL: ... shrank into yourself, and that...
- Why?

- ... that...
- What? 'Cause I, like, fucking...

I cried a little at my father's funeral?

That means I'm totally fucked forever?

That doesn't seem right.

KENDALL: It absolutely does
not make you a bad person.

Like, maybe it makes you a good person

that you weren't snaking at the funeral.

Like, maybe... maybe
you're well-adjusted,

and I'm a business psycho.
I don't know, man. It...

Like, it's... it's
a fucking horrible job

that clearly kills you.

So I'm just...

Honestly, I'm just trying
to guide us through the years

- to some truth here, man.
- Great, yeah. Cheesy.

- I'm serious.
- Yeah, serious

fuck' cheeseball is what you are.

He just can't say it.

He doesn't want it, but he can't say it.

And me?

I love you, Shiv. I fucking love you.

But we simply cannot walk in there

and say we're blocking his offer,

and we have this compelling vision,

and say that leading it
is you, when yesterday,

you were singing his
song. We simply can't.

And we can't say it's Roman

because he lacks heft, and
he... he looks pathetic,

and he might flop.

So...

Obviously, I want it to be me.

But I genuinely think anyone would say,

anyone, objectively, would say,

LA, my profile, experience, position,

desire, public pronouncements.

It's me.

If we want to hold on
to this company for us,

for my kids, for yours...

it's me.

than putting one foot
in front of the other.

Yeah, I don't think he wanted
to give it to any of us.

- SHIV: Yeah.

We could give it to him.

Yeah, we probably should.

- Unless...
- ROMAN: Unless?

Unless we k*ll him.

- Okay. k*ll him?
- SHIV: Yeah.

I like that. That's
intriguing. How would we do it?

Well, just a bit of
horseplay gone wrong.

Just a biff to the head
and a bonk on the noggin

- with a coconut.
- Wait till he goes limp.

- SHIV: Yeah.
- What goes around comes around?

Yeah. And if we k*ll him, we
get to go to bed. I'm tired.

But he'd be so annoying
if it went wrong.

The m*rder. Like...

"Did you just try to
m*rder me? Dude, that is...

so not actually what you're meant to do,

and it is not a good thing to do."

Hey. So, we were
thinking of m*rder you.

- Well, don't tell him.
- But, uh, you know...

Simon, how are you?

Good to see you. Thanks for being here.

- Ewan. New York's finest?

- FRANK: All right.

Let's call this meeting to order.

I note that all the
directors are present.

Uh, the agenda and the information packs

have been circulated and I
would like to take them as read.

We have a revised offer to
consider from the GoJo board,

and a lot of work has been
done to get us to a position

where we're ready to
sign if the board agrees.

As you also, of course, are aware,

we will be hearing from our co-CEOs

about strategic alternatives.

Uh, we've aired the issues
and heard from our advisors

on the GoJo proposal
in the previous session.

So now, I'd like to hand
the floor to Kendall.

Yeah, the... the GoJo offer.

(SIGHS) Uh, yeah, this... this deal...

The deal is a bad deal.

The GoJo offer.

We were proud to land it, me and Rome.

Uh, we know it inside
out, but it's a bad deal.

And if you want it to go through,

you'll have to f*re me
and find someone else

to take it through, yeah?

I think you have your packs here

with the structural arguments
and the financing options.

And look, it's a nice thick pack.

We've knocked it out of the park.

And, uh, GoJo, Matsson is flailing.

We know that.

So, look. Look. We know each other.

I've spoken to you all.

I like and respect every one of you,

but, uh, no one's gonna have
their mind changed in here.

Right?

So I suggest we move to the vote.

k*ll this, excuse me, GoJo bullshit.

And, you know, let's eat their lunch.

- Uh, Ken?
- What? You want me to read it out?

For due process? Come
on, we have the votes.

I would rather Simon.

Let's do it for my dad, guys. Yeah?

Would anyone object to
moving directly to a vote?

- BOARD MEMBERS: No.
- Uh, very well.

So, yes, I think it's a good deal.

I can't in good conscience as chair

vote any other way.

- Sonya?
- Yes.

- Diane?
- Yes.

Whether you want us to keep the company,

or hand it over to Tom

It's... it's... it's six to six

Shiv, can we go in that
room? Can you just vote?

Please. Please.

You can't be CEO.

You can't because you k*lled someone.

What do you... But... Which?

- SHIV: What?
- Wait, what do you mean "which"?

What? Like, what... Like,
you've k*lled so many people

you forgot which one?

It's a thing I said. I made it up.

- You made it up?
- KENDALL: Yeah. I...

I... I... It was a
difficult time for us,

and I think I, you know, whatever,

mussed up something from nothing

for us all to bond
at a difficult moment.
